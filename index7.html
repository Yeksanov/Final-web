        <p id="corn2">In 1899 August Horch wrote the first chapter in Audi’s history when he established the motor vehicle company known as Horch & Cie..
           Ten years later, he founded a second car manufacturing company: Audi Automobilwerke in Zwickau.</p>

        <p id="htext1">The beginnings</p>
        <p id="htext2"> AUDI AG is able to look back on an exciting and varied past – 
          its tradition of car and engine manufacturing extends back into the 19th century. 
          It all began with August Horch, one of Germany's pioneering personalities automobile engineers.
          After graduating from the Technical Academy in Mittweida,
          Saxony he worked on engine construction and later as head of the
          motor vehicle production department of the Carl Benz company in Mannheim.
          In 1899 he started his own business A.Horch & Cie. in Cologne.
          Horch moved to Saxony in 1902, first to Reichenbach then in 1904 to Zwickau, 
          where the company was transformed into a joint-stock corporation.</p>

      <div class="rings">
        <p id="ring1">Four rings – four brands</p>
        <p id="ring2">Four interlocking rings symbolised the merger of four automobile manufacturers based in the German state of Saxony: 
          Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer became Auto Union AG, then the second-largest motor vehicle manufacturing group in Germany. 
          Here are brief details of the roots of today’s AUDI AG.</p>

        <p id="audi1">Audi</p>
        <p id="audi2">The company established by August Horch in Zwickau on July 16,
           1909 could not take its founder's name for competitive reasons.
            A new name was found for the company by translating Horch’s name,
            which in German means "hark!" or "listen!", into Latin.
            The second company established by August Horch therefore commenced trading as Audi Automobilwerke GmbH,
            Zwickau on April 25, 1910.</p>

        <p id="lastw1">The Auto Union AG, Chemnitz</p>
        <ol id="lastw2">
          <li>On 29 June 1932, Audiwerke, Horchwerke and Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen AG (DKW) 
            merged on the initiative of the State Bank of Saxony to form Auto Union AG.</li>
          <li> A purchase and leasing agreement was concluded at the same time with Wanderer for the takeover of its motor vehicle division.
            The new company's head offices were in Chemnitz. Following the merger,
            Auto Union AG was the second-largest motor vehicle manufacturer in Germany.</li>
          <li> The company emblem consisted of four interlocking rings,
            intended to symbolise the inseparable unity of the four founder companies. 
            The Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer brand names were retained.</li>

    <div class = "bottom1"> <h5 id = "bottom" style="line-height: 20px;"> The specified fuel consumption and emission data have been determind according to the measurement procedures prescribed by law. Since 1st September 2017, certain new vehicles are already being type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), a more realistic test procedure for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Starting on September 1st 2018, the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) will be replaced by the WLTP in stages. Owing to the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions measured according to the WLTP will, in many cases, be higher than those measured according to the NEDC. Therefore, the usage of CO2 emission values measured according to WLTP for vehicle taxation from 1st September 2018 on can cause changes in this regards as well. For further information on the differences between the WLTP and NEDC, please visit www.audi.de/wltp.<br>

      <p style="font-size: 0px;">!</p>
      
      We are currently still required by law to state the NEDC figures. In the case of new vehicles which have been type-approved according to the WLTP, the NEDC figures are derived from the WLTP data. It is possible to specify the WLTP figures voluntarily in addition until such time as this is required by law. In cases where the NEDC figures are specified as value ranges, these do not refer to a particular individual vehicle and do not constitute part of the sales offering.<br>

      They are intended exclusively as a means of comparison between different vehicle types. Additional equipment and accessories (e.g. add-on parts, different tyre formats, etc.) may change the relevant vehicle parameters, such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics, and, in conjunction with weather and traffic conditions and individual driving style, may affect fuel consumption, electrical power consumption, CO2 emissions and the performance figures for the vehicle.<br>
