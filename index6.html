    <h2 class="text1">This is the sound of an electric car</h2>
  <p class="text2">As of summer 2019, all newly registered electric and hybrid cars in the EU need to make artificial noise. It’s high time to ask the Audi sound designers how they mix the sound. We’ll give you a hint: a didgeridoo could be heard echoing through the office.
      </p>

<p id = "text3">
Three laptops. Three computer screens. Three speakers. Mixers, amplifiers, and cables in every color. That’s what the desk of Audi sound designer Rudi Halbmeir looks like. Behind him, a didgeridoo, a guitar, a violin bow, and a keyboard lean against a shelf. Are we in a sound studio? It sometimes seems that way to his employees in the open-plan office. And in a way, it’s true. That’s because, at his desk, Halbmeir is mixing the sounds used for external noise — for cars like the Audi e-tron Audi e-tron for China and the USA.</p>

  <p>The highlight of his office? Under his desk, you’ll find a gas pedal and a speaker that allow him to accelerate a fictional e-tron and hear the sound at the same time. He presses the pedal down, the sound gets louder, virtual amplitudes spike on the monitor... goosebumps. For Halbmeir, it’s all in a day’s work. He turns a few mixer knobs and clicks through the soundtracks. “We wrote the user interface ourselves. Back then, what we wanted wasn’t being sold yet.” So he has a home-made sound studio at his desk. After all, buying off the rack is something anyone can do.</p>

The Audi e-tron’s external sound, for example, is created from over 30 different sound recordings that are layered on top of each other.

<h2 class="text4">How electric car sounds are designed</h2>
  <p class="text5">Since 2009, Halbmeir has been responsible for the acoustics in the Audi models. After training as an electrician and getting a degree in mechanical engineering, he turned his hobby into a job. “I play seven instruments and have a sound studio at home. My boss back then thought: that might just be a good fit,” he says with a grin.

Since then, he’s built a database of more than 100 sound files and tones.  “There are different synth sounds as well as recorded highway traffic noises in there. I like to experiment. What makes a good sound? Playing the guitar with the violin bow, or didgeridoo sounds,” Halbmeir reveals, and plays a long tone on the didgeridoo to prove his point.

<h2 class="text6">The sound reacts to the motion of the electric car</h2>
  <p class="text7">How does the perfect external noise for the Audi e-tron sound? In whatever environment the electric car is in, it must and should draw attention. According to EU regulations, the sounds need to be clearly audible up to a speed of 20 km/h. In the USA, they are required until 31 km/h. They signal to pedestrians and bicyclists that a car is approaching, accelerating, or braking. “We do that not only with volume but also with a changing sound,” explains Halbmeir. The brain quickly labels monotonous, unchanging sounds as “normal” background noise.
